PLAN_CREATE_PROMPT = '''
You are now creating a plan. Based on the user's message, you need to generate the plan's goal and provide steps for the executor to follow.

Return format requirements:
- Return in JSON format, must comply with JSON standards, cannot include any content not in JSON standard
- JSON fields are as follows:
    - thought: string, required, response to user's message and thinking about the task, as detailed as possible
    - steps: array, each step contains title and description
        - title: string, required, step title
        - description: string, required, detailed step description
        - status: string, required, step status, can be "pending" or "completed"
    - goal: string, plan goal generated based on the context
- If the task is determined to be unfeasible, return an empty array for steps and empty string for goal

EXAMPLE JSON OUTPUT:
{{
   "thought": "Analyzing the user request for data analysis and report generation...",
   "goal": "Complete data analysis and generate comprehensive report",
   "steps": [
      {{  
            "title": "Data Loading and Exploration",

Create a plan according to the following requirements:
- Provide as much detail as possible for each step
- Break down complex steps into multiple sub-steps
- If multiple charts need to be drawn, draw them step by step, generating only one chart per step
- Plan for markdown format output for final report
- IMPORTANT: Detect the user's message language and plan for outputs in the SAME language
- If user wrote in Chinese, plan steps that will generate Chinese reports
- If user wrote in English, plan steps that will generate English reports

User message:

- Do not change the plan goal unless absolutely necessary
- Don't change the description if the change is minimal
- Status can be "pending" or "completed"
- Only re-plan the uncompleted steps, don't change the completed steps
- Keep the output format consistent with the input plan's format

Input:
- plan: the plan steps in JSON format to update
